# Premium Website Starter (Formulation Services style)

This is a clean, premium starter you can deploy in minutes. It uses Tailwind (Play CDN) + a small JS reveal effect.
Perfect for prototyping before you move to a full Next.js + CMS build.

## Quick Start
1) Download the ZIP and unzip it.
2) Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
3) Deploy by dragging the folder into Netlify Drop (https://app.netlify.com/drop) or upload to Vercel as a static project.

## Files
- `index.html` — landing page with hero, services, process, work, about, contact.
- `assets/style.css` — small extra styles layered on Tailwind.
- `assets/script.js` — intersection observer for smooth section reveals.

## Next Steps (when you're ready)
- Rebuild in **Next.js** (create pages as components).
- Add **Sanity CMS** for Services, Case Studies, Blog.
- Replace Tailwind Play CDN with a proper Tailwind build (PostCSS) for production.
- Hook up the contact form to **Resend** or **SendGrid** via a serverless function.

## Licensing
You can use this scaffold freely. Replace images and text with your own.
